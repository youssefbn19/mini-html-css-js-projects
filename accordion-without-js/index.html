                <p>HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
                    web browser. It
                    defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
                    Cascading Style Sheets
                    and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

                    99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior. Web browsers have a
                    dedicated JavaScript engine
                    that executes the client code</p>
